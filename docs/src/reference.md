## High level picture

The high precision SDPA solvers do not provide a library interface, only binary
access. So SDPAFamily.jl takes the problem inputs from a MathOptInterface
Optimizer object and writes them to a file in a temporary folder (in the SDPA
format) and calls the binary. The binary reads the input file, solves the
problem, and writes an output file. SDPAFamily.jl then reads the output file and
populates the MathOptInterface Optimizer object.
